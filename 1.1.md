# 1.1 - Setup

- Download the latest release from [here]().
- I recommend downloading and using winrar for the next step, however, windows' built in extractor does work aswell.
- Unzip `Release.zip`, and extract it to the area you wish to install it in.
- Run requirements.bat to install all the required python imports (if pip doesn't work, try `python -m install <name>`)
