# 1 - Setup

- Download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/jiuhaywi/TornStatusDisplay/releases).
- I recommend downloading and using [**winrar**](https://www.win-rar.com/start.html?&L=0) for the next step (it is free), however, windows' built in extractor does work aswell.
- Unzip `TornStatusDisplay.zip`, and extract it to the area you wish to install it in.
- Run `requirements.bat` to install all the required python imports (if pip doesn't work, try `python -m install <name>`)

> requirements.bat does make a `RequirementsLog.txt` file, just incase it runs into any errors!
