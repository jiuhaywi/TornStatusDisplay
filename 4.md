# 4 - Setup

- Now, it should all be done!
- Run the main python file, and your logged in discord should now have an updating RPC attached.
- The timer updates every 5 seconds, and will update to the most recent API update every 5 minutes while flying so you aren't rate limited.
- If you have any questions about any of this, please contact me on discord (as outlined in readme.md)
