# 4 - Setup

- Now, it should all be done!
- Open up discord, you must be logged in with your account, and have discord running for the RPC to be applied.
- Run `TornRPC.py`, and your discord should now have an updating RPC attached.
- The timer updates every 5 seconds, and will update to the most recent API update every 5 minutes while flying so you aren't rate limited.
- If you have any questions about any of this, please contact me on discord (as outlined in readme.md)

## WARNING(/S)
>- Closing (or logging out of) discord, or closing the python file will stop the RPC, closing the connection.
>- This software does **NOT** modify any files outside of where you place it, and can easily be uninstalled by just deleting its files.
>- Have a good day (:
