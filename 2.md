# 2 - Setup

- Head [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and create a new Application.
- Name it whatever you want (Bear in mind that this will be displayed on your profile).
- Head to the **Rich Presence** tab, and upload your image files at the bottom, within **Rich Presence Assets** (included in the release if you dont want to customise them!).
- Go back to the **General Information** tab, and copy your **Application ID**. You will need this for later.
